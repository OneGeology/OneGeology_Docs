         The MXDtoWMS tool can help you create the complete MapServer
         map file including CLASS sections from an ESRI ArcMap . mxd
         file. There are versions for ArcGIS 8 and ArcGIS 9 supplied in
         the same download but only the version for ArcGIS 9 is
         described here.

         The tool produces complete map files and allows customization
         of the produced map files. However, we have not used this
         functionality and, for the purposes of this cookbook, we are
         only interested in the generation of the CLASS definitions, the
         other parts of the map file should be edited according to the
         instructions elsewhere in these cookbook pages.

         This tool is free and open source software released under the
         LGPL license. It can be obtained from the `ESRI support
         center <http://arcscripts.esri.com/details.asp?dbid=12766>`__
         (http://arcscripts.esri.com/details.asp?dbid=12766), the author
         would like an email if you use it and like it.
