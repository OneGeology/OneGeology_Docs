Mapping OneGeology-Europe data model to GeoSciML-Portrayal \| OneGeology
========================================================================

The following table is derived from the OneGeology-Europe WP5
and WP6 guidelines for preparing the datasets. **The table is
provided to assist those organizations that already have data
mapped to the OneGeology-Europe data model and wish to update
their services to use the same data for a GeoSciML-Portrayal
4.0 WMS service that will be INSPIRE conformant.**

When reading the table you should generally (such as excluding
headers) consider pairs of rows, where the  first row  refers
to the OneGeology-Europe data mapping (label, required status,
and description) and  the second row  is the corresponding
mapping in a GeoSciML-Portayal record. Descriptions that have a
line through them are regarded as obsolete (that is, refer to
the OneGeology-Europe data mapping that is either replaced or
not required in GeoSciML-Portrayal).

Generally you should note that URNs are deprecated and replaced
by HTTP-URIs, whether they be INSPIRE URIs, or CGI URIs.

We also provide some Excel spreadsheets (below) that map the
OneGeology-Europe URNs to their equivalent HTTP-URIs for both
the INSPIRE and CGI controlled vobabularies, that is:

`Mapping from OneGeology-Europe Lithology URNs <http://www.onegeology.org/docs/technical/OGEvocMap/3column-OGE-CGI-InspireURI-Mapping-LithologyREDUX.xlsx>`__ (<< link to Excel mapping spreadsheet)
   For example for mapping:
   *Lithology_1* to *representativeLithology_uri*

   For example for mapping:
   *AgeMax* or *EventAgeMax* to *representativeOlderAge_uri*,
   or
   *AgeMin* or *EventAgeMin* to *representativeYoungerAge_uri*,
   or
   *AgeMax* to *representativeAge_uri* (as BGS do in OGE

Mapping OneGeology-Europe GEOLOGIC UNITS to GeoSciML-Portrayal GeologicUnitView features
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That whilst many of the properties required for the
OneGeology-Europe GEOLOGIC UNITS mapping are optional, or not
specified by GeoSciML-Portrayal GeologicUnitView features,
GeoSciML-Portrayal mandates other properties (that is
properties not found in OneGeology-Europe) are defined, such as
representativeAge_uri. Please refer to the GeoSciML-Portrayal
`GeologicUnitView features <7_3_3.html>`__ page of the
cookboook for more information.

.. important ::
   In OneGeology-Europe the only types of structure that are being used are Faults and Contacts. Contacts are only being used to describe Calderas, Impact Craters, and Glacial Stationary Lines. Below we have separated Faults from Contacts becuase in GeoSciML-Portrayal they have different mappings.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. note ::
   Whilst many of the properties required for the OneGeology-Europe GEOLOGIC STRUCTURES mapping are optional, or not specified by GeoSciML-Portrayal ShearDisplacementStructureView features, GeoSciML-Portrayal mandates other properties (that is properties not found in OneGeology-Europe) are defined, such as movementType_uri and deformationStyle_uri. Please refer to the GeoSciML-Portrayal ShearDisplacementStructureView features page of the cookboook for more information.
