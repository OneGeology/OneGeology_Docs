OneGeology Technical Documentation
----------------------------------

There are two main areas being covered; first is how to use OneGeology and second (the major part) is how to provide services for OneGeology. Currently there is a bit of overlap in general OneGeology introductory type of material in the "cookbook" sections and other pages on the onegeology.org site. Other pages on the onegeology site that have overlapping content which we should consider together with cookbook content are:

* http://onegeology.org/what_is/home.html and all the subsections are introductions to OneGeology which we should point to where appropriate rather than duplicating.
* http://onegeology.org/participants/home.html is a high-level description of what it means to participate in OneGeolgy as a provider so could be pointed to from how to provide services introduction.
* http://onegeology.org/getting_involved/home.html and http://onegeology.org/getting_involved/get_involved.cfm are the bits participating organisations will have read and form submitted when expressing interest in becoming providers so note from service provision introduction.
* http://onegeology.org/portal/home.html - Should this page exist separately or instead be a direct link to cookbook chapter on portal?
* http://www.onegeology.org/misc/downloads.html?Accordion1=0#Cookbooks - Older versions of cookbooks
* http://www.onegeology.org/wmsCookbook/home.html - Older web version of WMS cookbook.
* The `Techical overview <http://onegeology.org/technical_progress/home.html>`_ and sub-sections feel like a bit of an oddity with a lot of overlap with cookbook high-level introductory content:
   * http://www.onegeology.org/technical_progress/technical.html
   * http://onegeology.org/technical_progress/users.html
   * http://www.onegeology.org/technical_progress/buddy_home.html
   * http://www.onegeology.org/technical_progress/accreditationForm.cfm
   * http://onegeology.org/technical_progress/geosciml.html
   * http://www.onegeology.org/technical_progress/esriGrantOffer.html
   * http://www.onegeology.org/use/home.html - replaced by this documentation
   * http://www.onegeology.org/service_provision/home.html - replaced by this documentation
   * http://onegeology.org/portal/portal_uses.html) 


These pages are specifically aimed at those involved in the detailed technical aspects of OneGeology and the processes required to provide your geological map data to the web. Minimum technical requirements and specifications are outlined and the levels of involvement possible are explained. This documentation replaces old documentation on http://www.onegeology.org and the separate WMS, WFS and WCS Cookbook PDF's.

For non-specialists
--------------------

The project's aim is to create dynamic digital geological map data for the world. This data will be made available from a portal via the Internet using the latest computing technology, GeoSciML. This approach allows different types of data and formats to be made available and will be accessible by anyone using the web.

There is no requirement for prior technical knowledge to be able to take part in the Initiative so please don't be discouraged by some of the technical aspects. The Technical Implementation Group has been set up to provide a methodology and series of 'user cookbooks' to guide participants through the process. These step-by-step 'cookbooks' will take you through the process from creating digital scans of paper maps if digital GIS data is not available, to 'serving' it on the web via the Portal. They will be available from this website in January 2008. A system to ensure support and advice is also currently being arranged.

Data licensing and ownership is also an important issue that we are frequently asked about. Map data served to the Internet as part of OneGeology will remain in the ownership of the originating geological survey or organisation, and ideally be available at no cost. The format of the 'web mapping and feature services' will allow registry and technical references, for example. Authorship of the data can be communicated by such things as the placement of each organisation's logo that is serving the data within their piece of the jigsaw. References will include the name of the data provider and a link to their home website. The legend for each map part of the jigsaw will be in the nation's home language, with each nation aiming to provide an English (and/or other) alternative when possible.

Principles:

- OneGeology benefits our agencies and our users.
- web visibility is very important.
- each contributor decides which maps to contribute.
- it is anticipated that the majority of contributed maps will be bedrock and/or superficial maps, lithological and/or lithostratigraphical and/or chronostratigraphical where possible, but again, each contributor decides.
