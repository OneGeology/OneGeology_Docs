         The Gix Export Tool can help you create the CLASS sections of
         your map file from an ESRI ArcView 3.x .apr file. This tool
         converts ESRI ArcView 3.x (NOT ArcMap) projects to common open
         source alternatives including a MapServer map file. (Please
         note that this tool has only been used to convert simple
         symbology e.g. geology polygons symbolized by a solid colour
         according to its lithology value. Its ability to convert more
         complex symbology has not been tested.) Download the `Gix
         Export Tool <http://gix.sourceforge.net/>`__
         (http://gix.sourceforge.net/). Run the executable and follow
         the instructions to install the tool as an ArcView 3.x
         extension. Having installed the Gix Export Tool, create or open
         an ArcView project containing your symbolized data.

         Complete the following steps to convert your project to a
         MapServer map file.

         #. Select View — Export View.

         #. The first screen asks you to select your output file format
            — choose MapServer map file (.map) and click next.

         #. The next screen asks you to select a version (choose
            default) and output file. The output file generated will be
            a temporary file from which you will cut the CLASS
            components and paste them into the master map file you have
            been creating elsewhere. Select a location for your output
            file and click next.

            click next.

         #. Click Finish to create your map file.

         Open up the map file you created in a text editor and complete
         the following steps for each layer in your map file:

         #. Navigate to the line beginning CLASSITEM
         #. Highlight from here down to the END #CLASS line associated
            with that layer
         #. Copy and paste the selected lines to an empty text file
         #. Delete all TEMPLATE ’ template.html’ lines (one for each
            class)
         #. Paste the remaining content into your master map file within
            the section for the layer you are dealing with. A good
            position is after the END line which closes the METADATA for
            that layer.

         If your symbolization in ArcView had polygon boundaries you
         will need to remove these from the MapServer symbolization.
         This may be easier to do by deleting all the ‘OUTLINECOLOR’
         lines from the generated map file than by altering your ArcView
         symbolization.
