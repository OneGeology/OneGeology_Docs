         Below is the GetCapabilities response returned by the BGS
         OneGeology service as configured by the MapServer map file
         shown in `Appendix E <appendixE.html>`__. This response
         document may be obtained using the following requests, that is,
         either as a `request without version
         parameter <http://ogc.bgs.ac.uk/cgi-bin/exemplars/BGS_Bedrock_and_Superficial_Geology/ows?service=WMS&request=GetCapabilities&>`__
         like:

         ::

            http://ogc.bgs.ac.uk/cgi-bin/exemplars/BGS_Bedrock_and_Superficial_Geology/ows?
              service=WMS&
              request=GetCapabilities&

         or as a `request with version
         parameter <http://ogc.bgs.ac.uk/cgi-bin/exemplars/BGS_Bedrock_and_Superficial_Geology/ows?service=WMS&request=GetCapabilities&version=1.3.0&>`__
         like:
         ::

            http://ogc.bgs.ac.uk/cgi-bin/exemplars/BGS_Bedrock_and_Superficial_Geology/ows?
              service=WMS&
              request=GetCapabilities&
              version=1.3.0&

         That is, the version parameter is omittable because the default
         service is always the highest version supported by the WMS
         server.
